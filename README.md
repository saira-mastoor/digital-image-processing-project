Data Preparation: Loaded, reshaped, and normalized the dataset. Converted labels to one-hot encoding.

Model Setup: Defined a CNN with Conv1D layers, max-pooling, dropout for regularization, and a softmax output layer for 10 classes.

Training: Compiled with Adam optimizer, trained for 10 epochs, and validated on test data.

Evaluation: Checked test accuracy and loss, then plotted training/validation performance to assess learning and overfitting.
